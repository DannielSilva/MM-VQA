Abstract: *Images in the medical domain are fundamentally different from the general domain images. Consequently, it is infeasible to directly employ general domain Visual Question Answering ( VQA ) models for the medical domain. Additionally,medical images annotation is a costly and time-consuming
process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a solution inspired by self-supervised pretraining of Transformer-style architectures for NLP , V ision and L anguage tasks. Our
method involves learning richer medical image and text semantic representations using Masked Language Modeling
(MLM) with image features as the pretext task on a large medical image+caption dataset. The proposed solution achieves
new state-of-the-art performance on two VQA datasets for
radiology images â€“ VQA - M ed 2019 and VQA - RAD , outperforming even the ensemble models of previous best solutions.
Moreover, our solution provides attention maps which help
in model interpretability.*

## VQARAD Results

MMBERT General, which is a single model for both the question types
in the dataset, outperforms the existing approaches including
the ones which have a dedicated model for each question
type.

| Method | Dedicated Models | Open Acc. | Closed Acc. | Overall Acc. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| MEVF + SAN | - | 40.7 | 74.1 | 60.8 |
| MEVF + BAN | - | 43.9 | 75.1 | 62.7 |
| Conditional Reasoning | :heavy_check_mark: | 60.0 | 79.3 | 71.6 |
| MMBERT General | :x: | 63.1 | 77.9 | 72.0 | 

## VQA-Med 2019 Results

Our MMBERT Exclusive achieves state-of-the-art results on the overall accuracy and BLEU score, even surpassing CGMVQA E ns. which
is an ensemble of 3 dedicated models for each category. Even
our MMBERT General performs better than the CGMVQA Ens.
on the abnormality and yes/no categories. Additionally, our
MMBERT General outperforms single dedicated CGMVQA
models in all the categories but modality.
